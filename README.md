<h1 align="center"> 🗒️ To-Dos</h1>

## Introduction
A Simple to-do app to simplify your days. Keep track of your tasks here.

## Features
- User Authentication with a login page that is validated; which means you can only create tasks after you are logged in. But don't worry, you can find the credentials on your console, use them and you're good to go!
- You can Create tasks, view them on the list, Update or even Delete them if you feel the need to (basically perform CRUD operations on them), and even cross them off, to see what tasks you've completed.
- And let me assure you, your tasks will remain there, even if you close the tab; so make sure you complete them, those tasks aren't going anywhere themselves!

## Future Amendments
- Generate cookies using random string using nextjs cookies, submit form using server actions
> Used LocalStorage instead for *authorization* and to *protect the private and public pages routes*
